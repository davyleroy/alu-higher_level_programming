# Higher-level programming - Python & Databases

This repository contains programs written for the higher-level programming
track at African Leadership Univrsity. In these projects, which began occurring in month
four of the year one curriculum, I learned Python, and MySQL.
Simultaneously, I continued to reinforce and expand my skills in C and shell
scripting. The specific list of projects contained follows:

* [. Python - Hello, World](./python-hello_world)
* [. Python - if/else, loops, functions](./python-if_else_loops_functions)
* [. Python - import & modules](./python-import_modules)
* [. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples](./python-data_structures)
* [. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary](./python-more_data_structures)
* [. Python - Exceptions](./python-exceptions)
* [. Python - Classes and Objects](./python-classes)
* [. Python - Test-driven development](./python-test_driven_development)
* [. Python - More Classes and Objects](./python-more_classes)
* [. Python - Everything is object](./python-everything_is_object)
* [. Python - Inheritance](./python-inheritance)
* [. Python - Input/Output](./python-input_output)
* [. Python - Almost a circle](./python-almost_a_circle)
* [. SQL - Introduction](./SQL_introduction)
* [. SQL - More queries](./SQL_more_queries)
* [. Python - Object-relational mapping](./python-object_relational_mapping)
* [. Python - Network #0](./python-network_0)
