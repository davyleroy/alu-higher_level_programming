# Higher-level programming - Python, Databases & JavaScript

This repository contains programs written for the higher-level programming
track at African Leadership Univrsity. In these projects, which began occurring in month
four of the year one curriculum, I learned Python, and MySQL.
Simultaneously, I continued to reinforce and expand my skills in C and shell
scripting. The specific list of projects contained follows:

* [. Python - Hello, World](./0x00-python-hello_world)
* [. Python - if/else, loops, functions](./0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions)
